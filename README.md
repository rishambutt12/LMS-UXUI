# LMS UXUI Web Design
In Task 5, I created a Library Management System with roles for Admin, Student, and Teacher. The system includes login/signup screens, a personalized landing page, book request forms, and an admin dashboard. The Admin can manage users, add/edit books, and view reports, while students and teachers can request and view books.
